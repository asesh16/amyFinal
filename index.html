        <p>
        My father has always loved to hunt and fish and he was a stay-at-home dad while my mom worked.
        Instead of just staying home with us and giving up his hobbies, he just took us with him when he would go do his favorite activites. 
        I grew up being outside all the time and now my favorite things to do are outdoors.

        Some of the things I like to do include:
        <ol>
            <li>Fishing
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal fishing</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I started out fishing with a spinning rod. Most people who fish just use spinning rods. I like to use them when we are fishing off of a boat but it usually isn't my go-to method for fishing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Ice fishing</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I had never ice fished before I met my boyfriend. We met in 2021 and he took me ice fishing that winter and now I go every winter. I enjoy sitting in the ice tent and hanging out with everyone. I haven't caught very big fish through the ice, but I still enjoy it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Fly fishing</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fly gishing is my favorite form of fishing. I have caught all my biggest fish on a fly rod and I really enjoy doing it. My dad taught me how to fly fish at a young age but I only became interested in it a couple of years ago. I rarely keep the fish I catch so I almost always just catch and release. I mostly catch trout on the fly rod.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Bow fishing</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This year (2023) was my first year bow fishing. This is another activity that my boyfriend introduced me to and I had a lot of fun doing it. We bow fish for carp because they are an invasive species and the government encourages people to kill them.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Hunting
                <ul>
                    <li>Duck hunting</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is another activity that I was recently introduced to. This was my first year duck hunting and I enjoy it, but don't love the taste of duck and we eat every animal we kill. I have so far only successfully gotten 2 ducks. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Shed hunting</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shed hunting doesn't involve killing any animals. It's just hiking around and looking for the antlers from deer and elk when they shed them. I really enjoy doing this. I started in 2021 and have enjoyed going each time. You can make money from selling sheds, but I just think it's cool to find them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Upland bird hunting</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have been pheasant hunting with my dad since I was little. It has always been a tradition to go each thanksgiving. We usually go in Montana where my dad grew up.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Big game hunting</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have never actually killed a deer or elk myself, but I enjoy tagging along with my dad or my boyfriend when they go hunting for them. I heloed my boyfriend scout an elk this year and helped him pack it out when he got it.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Other activities
                <ul>
                    <li>Hiking</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I enjoy hiking to get in touch with nature. I like hiking because it allows me to be outside and unwind in the outdoors without any pressure to do anything. It is also free which is nice because a lot of the other activities are somewhat expensive. Some of my favorite hikes in Utah are Rock Canyon, the Upper Falls at the Bridal Veil Falls, and some of the ones in the National parks. I also hiked some 14ers in Colorado which were challenging but very rewarding. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Backpacking</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I go backpacking with my family every summer. Whenever we go backpacking, we always try to pack into somewhere that we can fish. Some of my favorite backpacking trips were to the Sand Creek Lakes in Colorado and the Cloud Peak wilderness in the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Snowboarding</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I grew up in Colorado so I have been snowboarding for most of my life. I don't do anything very extreme but I love to go and hit the slopes whenever I have the time and money to do it. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Golfing</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have been golfing almost my entire life. It is one of my favorite summer activites. I played on my high school varsity golf team and have tried to go during the summer as much as I can afford (which isn't much). My favorite golf course in Utah is the Hobble Creek golf course.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
